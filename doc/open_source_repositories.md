# Open Source Repository List  

The Vector Robot is a versatile, fun companion for various projects, and we encourage you to use the additional resources and code that we have created to extend Vector's functionality and to customize your robot to exactly how you want it. The documentation on these items is a work in progress and we will continue to explore new examples and use cases so you can get an idea of how to use these tools and what applications they can help with. Here is a comprehensive listing of all publicly available Vector-related repositories:

## Software Development Kits
Vector has 2 main software development kits, based upon Python and Go. These SDKs can be used to create new apps that connect to Vector and utilize the robot's sensors and functionality!
